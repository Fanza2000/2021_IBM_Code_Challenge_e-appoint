# Problem Statement

Despite this digital era, people still wait in long lines to get services from government offices. Waiting in long queues can be quite tiresome for the elderly who are required to stand for long periods of time. In certain unexpected situations, there is time wastage in government offices. There is loss of effort and money if the service could not be availed at the particular day.
